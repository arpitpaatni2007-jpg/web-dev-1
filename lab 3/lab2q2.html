<p>Wildlife encompasses all non-domesticated, living organisms found in their natural environments, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance and food chains. However, human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, and poaching have severely threatened wildlife populations, leading to species extinction and risking others. Wildlife conservation efforts, including the establishment of national parks and the implementation of laws like the Indian Wildlife Act of 1972, are crucial for protecting biodiversity, preserving natural heritage, and ensuring the long-term stability of ecosystems for future generations. </p><br><hr>

<p>Photography is the art and practice of capturing images by recording light, either electronically with a digital sensor or chemically on film, to create a permanent record. It serves as a powerful tool for artistic expression, preserving memories, documenting events, and communicating messages across a universal language. From its beginnings with early film cameras to the modern era of digital and mobile photography, it has become an omnipresent and versatile art form with applications in science, business, and personal life.</p><br><hr>
